            "content": "After watching the Psychology and the Good Life video and looking at hacks, one thing that stood out to me was the goals in conjunction with happy people. I found that there are many ways that goals can affect happiness. Goals can directly affect happiness because when a goal is achieved, a person usually feels pleasure and therefore happiness. This is why I think it is important to set realistic specfic, and productive goals. In addition, getting distracted from goals can increase working time and therefore decrease free time. I personally experience this when doing my homework, and end up with little free time. This is an indirect effect of goals on happiness, more motivation means less working time and more free time to be social which is stated in the video to be related with happiness. .",

            "content": "Planning . Before creating this quiz, my partner and I took a general look at how the App Lab worked, trying out some ideas we could implement in our quiz. We came up with a button function(named &quot;but&quot; in my quiz code), which takes two inputs, name and screen. The function takes the user to the specified screen when the button with the specified name is clicked. This is an important function because there are many times when a button leads to a different screen in our quizzes. . Program Purpose and Function . The purpose of this App Lab is to demonstrate different aspects of JavaScript. The function of this App Lab is to create and score a quiz app that has three questions. . Data Abstraction . An example of Data Abstraction in this quiz is the &quot;colors&quot; list. It stores multiple values that represent different colors. A random number function takes a random color from the list and sets the background as that color. . Managing Complexity . An example of complexity management in this quiz is the overall organization. The quiz is split into three parts: start, questions, and finish. This can easily be seen in the first part of the code, as each has its own defined function. Later on, each of the functions are called, making the code visually easier to understand. . Procedural Abstraction . One procedure in the quiz is the if statement in the &quot;finish&quot; function. It states that if the number of correct answers is greater than the number of questions in the quiz, then the user will be notified that they cheated. . Algorithm Implementation . An algorithm implementaion in the quiz is the for loop in the &quot;start&quot; function. It goes through a list of all of the screens in the quiz and changes the background color for each one. . Testing . One way that the quiz can be tested is answering all three questions right one time, and answering only two correct another time. On the first trial, the quiz should show a score of 100 percent. On the second trial, the quiz should show a score of 67 percent. .",

A design that I think would be good for the Create Performance Task is a game show, which could include a variety of games, each demonstrating a requirement for the Create Performance Task. . The purpose and function of the code could be explained in the code or elsewhere . A multiple choice question could utilize a list to satisfy the Data Abstraction requirement. . A defined function to ask several multiple choice questions could satisfy the managing complexity requirement by reducing repetive code to a few function calls. . An if statement could be used to satisfy the procedural abstraction requirement. For example, if the contestant scores a certain amount of questions on a section correctly, they move on. If not, they are out of the game. . A for loop can be used for a word guessing game to satisfy the algorithm implementation requirement. One letter of a word could be revealed until the contestant can get the word, if they get it in a certain amount of time they win. . The author of the code could use different inputs to test the precision and functionality of the code to satisfy the testing requirements. .",

            "content": "InfoDb Database background The InfoDb database is a python dictionary, structured with values that are associated with keys. This makes it simple to extract specific information from a dictionary, based on its key. You can use database.append to add to the database. . Here, information is manually input into a dictionary called InfoDb using database.append. . InfoDb = [] #defining InfoDb as a dictionary InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Jaden&quot;, #&quot;key&quot;: &quot;value&quot; &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Nguyen&quot;, &quot;FavFood&quot;: &quot;March 16&quot;, &quot;FavColor&quot;: &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;CellPhone&quot;: &quot;8589148661&quot;, &quot;Age&quot;: &quot;15&quot;, &quot;Siblings&quot;: [&quot;Brian&quot;, &quot;Katelyn&quot;] }) print(InfoDb) . [{&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Jaden&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Nguyen&#39;, &#39;FavFood&#39;: &#39;March 16&#39;, &#39;FavColor&#39;: &#39;Blue&#39;, &#39;CellPhone&#39;: &#39;8589148661&#39;, &#39;Age&#39;: &#39;15&#39;, &#39;Siblings&#39;: [&#39;Brian&#39;, &#39;Katelyn&#39;]}] . Here, I created functions collect_data and more_info to add to the database using input. . more_info is a while loop. As long as the input to &quot;Do you want to enter information?&quot; is &quot;Yes&quot;, the function will prompt the user to input information, then ask again. If it is any other answer, the loop ends. . I also made a function print_db to print the contents of the database neatly. The output contains a second person&#39;s information that was added using collect_data and more_info. . def collect_data(): fn = input(&quot;What is your first name? &quot;) #storing inputs in variables ln = input(&quot;What is your last name? &quot;) ff = input(&quot;What is your favorite food? &quot;) fc = input(&quot;What is your favorite color? &quot;) cell = input(&quot;What is your phone number? &quot;) age = input(&quot;What is your age? &quot;) sibs = input(&quot;What are your siblings&#39; names, from oldest to youngest? &quot;) InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: fn, #&quot;key&quot;: &quot;value&quot; but with variables &quot;LastName&quot;: ln, &quot;FavFood&quot;: ff, &quot;FavColor&quot;: fc, &quot;CellPhone&quot;: cell, &quot;Age&quot;: age, &quot;Siblings&quot;: [sibs] }) def more_info(): while True: ans = input(&quot;Do you want to add more info to the database? &quot;) if ans == &quot;yes&quot;: name = True collect_data() #collect data if input is &quot;yes&quot; print() else: #stop function if input isn&#39;t &quot;yes&quot; break more_info() def print_db(db): print(&quot;Here is the information for &quot; + db[&quot;FirstName&quot;], db[&quot;LastName&quot;] + &quot;:&quot;) #get &quot;value&quot; using database[&quot;key&quot;] print() print(&quot;Favorite Food: &quot; + db[&quot;FavFood&quot;]) print(&quot;Favorite Color: &quot; + db[&quot;FavColor&quot;]) print(&quot;Phone Number: &quot; + db[&quot;CellPhone&quot;]) print(&quot;Age: &quot; + db[&quot;Age&quot;]) print(&quot;Siblings: &quot; + &quot;, &quot;.join(db[&quot;Siblings&quot;])) print() print() . . Here, more_recursion is a function that has the same purpose as more_info, but uses recursion instead of a while loop. When the input is &quot;yes&quot;, the function is repeated. When it is anything else, the function ends. . def more_recursion(): ans = input(&quot;Do you want to add more info to the database? &quot;) if ans == &quot;yes&quot;: name = True collect_data() print() more_recursion() #function inside of the same function is recursion else: return more_recursion() . . Here is a for loop. It says: for each person in the database, print the person&#39;s information(using the print_db function). . for person in InfoDb: #for each &quot;person&quot; in teh database, print the person&#39;s information print_db(person) . Here is the information for Jaden Nguyen: Favorite Food: March 16 Favorite Color: Blue Phone Number: 8589148661 Age: 15 Siblings: Brian, Katelyn Here is the information for jacques webster: Favorite Food: mcdonalds Favorite Color: brown Phone Number: 9021090210 Age: 31 Siblings: ye, scott, don Here is the information for jeffrey williams: Favorite Food: snakes Favorite Color: green Phone Number: 1234567890 Age: 31 Siblings: sergio, pluto . Here, I used a for loop with index to list the letters of each person&#39;s name in order. . def let_sort(sub): name = sub[&quot;FirstName&quot;] for let in name: # for each letter in the person&#39;s name place = (name.index(let) + 1) #&quot;place&quot; is the letter&#39;s spot, +1 because index starts at 0 print(&quot;Letter number &quot; + str(place) + &quot; in &quot; + name + &quot; is &quot; + let) for person in InfoDb: let_sort(person) print() .

Hacks . Is there anything we use to verify tools we install? Think about versions. &quot;conda --version&quot; gives the current version of Anaconda installed. . Is there anything we could verify with Anaconda? &quot;conda list&quot; verifies the packages in a conda environment. . How would you update a repository? &quot;git pull&quot; matches your local repository to the GitHub repository. After making changes, &quot;git push origin master&quot; can be used to sync the Github repository with your local, edited version. . Really cool would be automating a procedure from installation. A shell script can be created to automate procedures. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
