    "\n",
    "Overall, the CSUSM was insightful and gave me more comfort about college, which is a stressful and unfamiliar topic to me. In addition, I learned more about the computer science experience at CSUSM and college in general. It was helpful to hear from actual students of CSUSM because they expereinced the actual admission process and education at the school. I learned about many programs, internships, and clubs that I am interested in and will try to look for no matter what college I attend. Furthermore, I learned a lot about the finance of college, which I previously knew little about. "
