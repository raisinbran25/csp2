    "There are many different perspectives and viewpoints for copyright. For one, people or companies may not want others to use their work without permission because they lose profit. On the other hand, a small creator may not want copyright because it helps them grow and spread. Finally, some argue that copyright is generally ineffective, people always find a way to copy.\n",

Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update.  \n",

    "I chose Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal because I do not intend to profit from any of the work in my repository. I hope I can reach other CSP students who are interested in creating code inspired by my work. I did this by removing previous LICENSE file and creating a new one with correct license.\n"
