    "Before creating this quiz, my partner and I took a general look at how the App Lab worked, trying out some ideas we could implement in our quiz. We came up with a button function(named \"but\" in my quiz code), which takes two inputs, name and screen. The function takes the user to the specified screen when the button with the specified name is clicked. This is an important function because there are many times when a button leads to a different screen in our quizzes.  \n"
