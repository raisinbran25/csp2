    "Okay, so we've learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there's a more advanced program you don't know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. \n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word from, followed by the package name, then the word \"import\", then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package's name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use \"*\".\n",
