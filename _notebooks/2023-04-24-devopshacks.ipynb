    "Virtual desktops are computers within computers. This is helpful because you can test or perform something that could otherwise be harmful to a real computer. It can be easily disposed of if something happens to it. A virtual desktop can be utilized in APCSP to test the abilities of a computer with specific hardware/software.\n",

    "\n",
    "We use DNS to make a website public instead of limiting it to a local website. It works by assigning a domain name to a dynamic ip address. DuckDNS is unique because it is free of cost. It is useful for our projects because it allows other people to access our project from their device. To set up DuckDNS, sign in with github, create a url, add ip, and create domain."

According to OpenSSL, \"Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may be vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks\" because \"Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silently ignored by OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks are skipped for that certificate. A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies in order to circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether.\""
