title: Night at the Museum Blog

Night at the Museum was a great oppurtunity to show my work and see the work that my friends have done, both from computer science and other classes. One computer science project that interested me was the VASE project. It had a symptom picker whose results were processed by an algorithm to identify a problem with the user's body.  
  
I was impressed by the work in the AP Studio Art classroom, some drawings looked as realistic as photographs. In the ceramics room, I was drawn to a ceramic paper plane, it was ironic that you could not actually use it as intended. In the Animation classroom, some pieces looked simple at first glance, but I realized that all of the aspects in each setting had to be made manually.  
  
Some project ideas I have for next trimester are:  
  
-user input  
-game show  
-sorter program  
-flight tracker
