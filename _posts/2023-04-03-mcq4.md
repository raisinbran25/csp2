Question 2:
The answer I chose is incorrect because both region and search term are collected by the trend-tracking feature. Choice C is correct because specific information about a search term, such as cost, is not collecte by the feature.

Question 3:
I chose D because I thought that since the algorithm had a squared time complexity it was unreasonable because it was more steep than linear. However, a square time complexity is actually reasonable.
