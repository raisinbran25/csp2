## Reflection

skills you have obtained
One skill I have obtained this year is javascript. I already knew some python coming into the class, but knew no javascript. During the code.org activity, I remember being intimidated when taking away the blocks and actually showing the javascript code. However, I found that python and javascript have many similarities. I learned how to use aws and connect backend to frontend. Furthermore, I learned how to use extentions such as numpy for python.  

One high that I had this year was successfuly making minesweeper. This was the first big game that I created, and first general big project in javascript. I ran into many issues but ultimately figured it out in the end. Many of my peers were impressed with my skills and this helped me make more javascript games and utilities.  

I may take CSA, either in senior year or online sometime. I may go into CS field and job, but for now I want to explore different STEM branches such as physics. However, I know I will need CS expereience because I have heard that CS shows up in many other fields such as mathematics.  

## N@TM

I enjoyed showing off what I created this trimester to teachers, parents, and other students. It was also cool to see how other groups utilized the same concepts in different ways. One project I saw was a gallery maker, which had capabilities to view the image in high quality and even send or post images through social media.

I also saw another geoguesser variant, similar to the one my group made. It was interesting to see how each of us went about each concept in geoguesser, like zooming in for example.

Below is an image of me showing my group's geoguesser to another group.

I also visited other classes, this is something I have enjoyed in previous Night at the Museum events. Below is a Spongebob drawing that I loved because Spongebob is my favorite show.

Below is a minion cup that I thought looked funny. It is cool to see how in every class, like band or ceramics or even cs, you can show your creativity through your work.
