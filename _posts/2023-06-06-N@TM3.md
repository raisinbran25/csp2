title: Night at the Museum Blog Tri 3

I enjoyed showing off what I created this trimester to teachers, parents, and other students. It was also cool to see how other groups utilized the same concepts in different ways. One project I saw was a gallery maker, which had capabilities to view the image in high quality and even send or post images through social media.

I also saw another geoguesser variant, similar to the one my group made. It was interesting to see how each of us went about each concept in geoguesser, like zooming in for example.

Below is an image of me showing my group's geoguesser to another group.

I also visited other classes, this is something I have enjoyed in previous Night at the Museum events. Below is a Spongebob drawing that I loved because Spongebob is my favorite show.

Below is a minion cup that I thought looked funny. It is cool to see how in every class, like band or ceramics or even cs, you can show your creativity through your work.
