## CSP

My project worked as planned during my presentation time and it was a great experience to explain my project, how it works, and CSP in general to parents and students. I did not get the chance to do this as much last tri, and overall it helped me make connections between CSP and the real world.  

One other project I came across was CarHub from team orborb. They did a great job of pulling from backend API in addition to filtering and sorting from user input. In addition, users could give feedback in a certain section of the website.

In the 3D animation class, I liked the theme of the donuts.

In the ceramics class. I found a gnome that would fit in my backyard.

The AP Art exhibit had a line but was worth the wait, I found these realistic drawings/paintings.
