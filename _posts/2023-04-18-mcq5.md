## Below are the questions I got wrong/had trouble on:

Question 1:
The first option is wrong because first and second will be the same thing. The second option is correct because second is set to temp, which holds the initial value of first.

Question 30:
The Analysis function does run four times because the loop iterates through the list which has four items, but the function is also run initially, before the loop, meaning it is run 5 times for a time of 5 hours.

Question 50:
The procedure does not have binary search, there is no greater than or less than comparisons. However, there is an equal comparison, meaning the procedure has linear search.
