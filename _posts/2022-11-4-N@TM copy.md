Question 2:  
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/final2.png "")  
I got this question wrong because I thought that if not true, false would be displayed. However, y is only displayed "if y", so it will only display true.  
  
Question 36:  
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/final36.png "")  
I got this question wrong because my answer prints odd numbers. Instead, multiplying each number from my question by two would be a correct option as it store even numbers.
