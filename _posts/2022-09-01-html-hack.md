Below is an image of my website with the cayman theme. One issue that I noticed with this remote theme is that my links that are normally in the top right of my front page are missing.

Below is the "tags" page of my website. I have tags for each week, which are in the front matter of each notebook.

Here are two images showing my "Search" page. By searching for the tag for a specific week, all of the notebooks from that week appear.

[Here is a link](https://raisinbran25.github.io/csp2/calendar/) to my calendar page. It includes a table organized in a similar way to the class schedule, sorted by weeks and days, and has links to each notebook.
