Question 42:  
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q43.png "https://github.com/raisinbran25/csp2")  
I chose A because I thought that real trends and results are needed to inspire proccesses in the computer simulation. While this can be true, real data is not necessary in all simulations. The correct answer is C, because there are so many factors in real life that not all of them can be accounted for in a computer simulation.

  
Question 45:  
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q45.png "https://github.com/raisinbran25/csp2")  
I chose A because I incorrectly recalled the definition of heuristic; I thought that a heuristic approach could be used in a situation that could be solved in a reasonable time. However, if the problem could be solved in a reasonable time, heuristics would not be necessary. The correct answer is C, because a heuristic approach would most help when a problem cannot be solved in a reasonable time and an approximate solution is acceptable.

  
Overall Reflection: I am comfortable with most of the robot movement and general pseudocode questions, but need to review boolean, heuristics, and simulations. I will revisit AP videos and practice questions and on each topic.
